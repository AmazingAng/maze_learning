Hippocampal coding of maze exploration

# Data:
## Behavior results:

correct time, wrong time: time (seconds) spent on correct (both location and direction) and incorrect path

decision_rate: percentage of corrected decision made (计算方法可能有错)

half_level_proportion: proportion of time spent on first half levels of maze.

stop_time_mean, stop_time median: mean and median of stopping time (number of consecutive frames that mice remain on the same node).

speed (cm/s): mean of instantaneous speed (speed at each frame)
